  <p><strong>The Ladies of Leisure are women of independent means.</strong> They have no duties or responsibilities to anyone other than themselves. These gentlewomen <strong>navigate the modern world with tips, tricks and suggestions from the Good Housekeeping Guide of the 1960s.</strong> There’s nothing that can’t be solved by self-reliance, friendship and a strong martini.</p>
  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/emarchak">Erin Marchak</a>, Joan Patch, <a href="http://twitter.com/candacemeeks">Candace Meeks</a> and Tracy Bradley are the Ladies, and they have been <strong>improvising collectively for more than a decade.</strong> They’re alumni of Second City, Impatient Theatre, Bad Dog Theatre and the Toronto Fringe. </p>
